"Arena"-like scenario:
- Free-for-all
- Winner keeps all remaining mass, weapons, defense of loser

"Challenge" mode:
- Wager mass, energy, equipment, etc. "pink-slip" style
- Winner wins the wagered items

"Arena mode" and special items
- Make special items' info public: identity of owners, locations on map (visual "beacon" or radar blips).
- To avoid item-squatting, owners must defend items at least N times per week, and cannot fight the same person more than once per X days (to avoid using weak opponents to satisyf min. fight frequency so that owner can squat on item).
